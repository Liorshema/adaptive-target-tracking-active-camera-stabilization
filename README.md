# Adaptive Target Tracking Testbed

A modular ROS 2 and Gazebo testbed for developing, testing, and comparing target-tracking methods for mobile robotic systems.

The platform follows a complete closed-loop pipeline:

**Measurement → Estimation → Prediction → Reference → Control → Robot Motion**

It is designed so that robot models, estimators, predictors, adaptation methods, controllers, target dynamics, and experiment configurations can be replaced independently without changing the overall architecture.

## Main Components

- `robot_description` — robot geometry and physical configuration
- `robot_models` — reusable robot, camera, and whole-body models
- `robot_perception` — target detection and measurement generation
- `robot_estimation` — robot and target state estimation
- `robot_prediction` — target-motion prediction and online adaptation
- `robot_control` — tracking and robot command generation
- `robot_simulation` — target dynamics, disturbances, and Gazebo simulation
- `robot_experiments` — experiments, logging, metrics, and comparison
- `robot_bringup` — system configuration and launch files

The workspace is organized into separate ROS 2 packages with clear responsibilities.

## Goal

The goal of the project is to provide a reusable experimental platform for evaluating different approaches to robotic target tracking while keeping the core system architecture stable.

> **Keep the testbed stable while allowing the algorithms inside it to evolve.**
